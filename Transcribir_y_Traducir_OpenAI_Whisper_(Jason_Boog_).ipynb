            "[02:31.000 --> 02:38.000]  It's like his Twitter thread. The very first tweet of this thread is, I'm going to get rich, and this is how I'm going to do it.\n",
            "[02:38.000 --> 02:44.000]  He's not like, oh, I hope to make some money. He's like, no, I'm going to get insanely wealthy.\n",
            "[02:45.000 --> 02:49.000]  He's like Babe Ruth pointing to the outfield exactly where he's going to hit the ball.\n",
            "[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  He's not, hey, guys, I made something. Hashtag building in public.\n",
            "[02:53.000 --> 02:56.000]  Oh, here he is. What's up, Lucas? Hi, Liz.\n",
            "[02:56.000 --> 02:57.000]  Hey, guys.\n",
            "[02:57.000 --> 03:02.000]  We were just talking about your Twitter thread, Lucas, and I think it's amazing.\n",

            "[03:05.000 --> 03:11.000]  Like Sean Perry from My First Million came on our show very recently, and he was kind of like, you guys are doing small boy stuff.\n",

            "[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  I mean, even your Twitter background, you've got these three mountains.\n",
            "[03:23.000 --> 03:28.000]  And the first mountain is like a little stick figure walking up it, and it's like a million dollars a year in revenue.\n",
            "[03:28.000 --> 03:33.000]  And there's another mountain after that. It's a little bigger, and it's like $100 million a year in revenue.\n",
            "[03:33.000 --> 03:36.000]  And the third mountain is like something crazy.\n",
            "[03:36.000 --> 03:38.000]  And then even your progress bar.\n",
            "[03:38.000 --> 03:44.000]  Every indie hacker has the same progress bar under their Twitter profile, where you've got the boxes.\n",
            "[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  And on the left, it's like $0. On the right, it's your goal.\n",
            "[03:46.000 --> 03:49.000]  And you color the boxes green the further you get.\n",
            "[03:49.000 --> 03:53.000]  And most of us are like, yeah, $10,000 a month is my goal, or $20,000.\n",
            "[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  And yours is like a million dollars.\n",

            "[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  And by the way, we can't let them off the hook.\n",

            "[04:13.000 --> 04:15.000]  Then I'll bootstrap a product.\n",

            "[04:21.000 --> 04:30.000]  And then you do something that's so funny, which is you predict a point that happens in a lot of people's journey that always blindsides them.\n",

            "[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  My parents' retirement is secured.\n",
            "[04:39.000 --> 04:40.000]  What next?\n",
            "[04:40.000 --> 04:41.000]  Then I remember.\n",

            "[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  I'm excited about my SpaceX.\n",
            "[04:45.000 --> 04:55.000]  You completely draw this thing out in a way that even the people who do reach these goals don't see all the steps coming the way that you've laid it out.\n",
            "[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  Yeah, it's pretty cool.\n",
            "[04:57.000 --> 05:01.000]  The funny thing here is we are big fans of My First Million.\n",
            "[05:01.000 --> 05:05.000]  And then one day, out of the blue, Sam started following.\n",
            "[05:05.000 --> 05:09.000]  And I'm a big Sam fan, and he is a big Sean fan.\n",
            "[05:09.000 --> 05:11.000]  And then I was like, ah, Sam follows me.\n",
            "[05:11.000 --> 05:13.000]  And I even tweeted, oh, I think it was by mistake.\n",
            "[05:13.000 --> 05:14.000]  And then he answered.\n",
            "[05:14.000 --> 05:18.000]  Sam answered and said, no, no, I like what you're doing, and that's why I followed you.\n",
            "[05:18.000 --> 05:25.000]  And then a few weeks later, he tweeted something actually saying, and then I'm going to be interviewed on My First Million.\n",
            "[05:25.000 --> 05:27.000]  And then Sean started following him.\n",
            "[05:27.000 --> 05:30.000]  And I was like, okay, we are on the path here.\n",
            "[05:30.000 --> 05:33.000]  I was like, I'm going to make this killer tweet.\n",
            "[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  And I even looked up the Disney story spine.\n",
            "[05:37.000 --> 05:41.000]  That's like, you know, things happen all the time, and then happens this, and then happens this.\n",
            "[05:41.000 --> 05:47.000]  But one day, I was like, okay, I'm going to write a tweet exactly like the Pixar storyline.\n",
            "[05:47.000 --> 05:48.000]  Yeah, the Pixar.\n",
            "[05:48.000 --> 05:49.000]  And it totally worked.\n",
            "[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  So let's clue people into what you guys are doing here.\n",
            "[05:53.000 --> 05:56.000]  It's very simple, but it's very good.\n",
            "[05:56.000 --> 05:58.000]  It's called stagetimer.io.\n",
            "[05:58.000 --> 06:02.000]  So let's say I'm running a conference or an event where I've got speakers.\n",
            "[06:02.000 --> 06:07.000]  I want my speakers to all know, like, pretty simple, how much time do they have left in their talk?\n",
            "[06:07.000 --> 06:09.000]  Is it 10 minutes? Is it 30 minutes?\n",
            "[06:09.000 --> 06:15.000]  And I want it to be, like, on some sort of laptop or screen or iPad that they can see while they're talking so they don't go over time.\n",
            "[06:15.000 --> 06:20.000]  But I want to also be able to control that, pretty much everything about that timer from, like, the comfort of my seat.\n",
            "[06:20.000 --> 06:24.000]  I don't want to have to be running up to the stage, telling them how much time is left, or pressing pause on the screen.\n",
            "[06:24.000 --> 06:27.000]  And so that's basically what stagetimer.io is.\n",
            "[06:27.000 --> 06:34.000]  You basically sign on to your website, you create a timer, and you get this whole dashboard with all these cool controls to control a timer.\n",
            "[06:34.000 --> 06:36.000]  I can add time to it, reset it, make it flash.\n",
            "[06:36.000 --> 06:37.000]  I can have multiple timers.\n",
            "[06:37.000 --> 06:40.000]  I can show messages, whatever I want I can do.\n",
            "[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  And then there's another link I can give people.\n",
            "[06:42.000 --> 06:45.000]  It's like a special view to the timer that I set up for my speakers.\n",
            "[06:45.000 --> 06:50.000]  And that will just show them the timer, and it will just show them any messages I send to the timer that I can control.\n",
            "[06:50.000 --> 06:53.000]  And that's, as far as I can tell, that's pretty much it.\n",
            "[06:53.000 --> 06:56.000]  And I think you're charging, like, $20 a month, $30 a month for this.\n",
            "[06:56.000 --> 07:01.000]  And you are at, last I saw, $8,000 a month in revenue.\n",
            "[07:01.000 --> 07:03.000]  Yeah, a bit more already.\n",
            "[07:03.000 --> 07:04.000]  Yeah.\n",
            "[07:04.000 --> 07:05.000]  I mean, this is the dream.\n",
            "[07:05.000 --> 07:06.000]  Channing and I were talking before you came on.\n",
            "[07:06.000 --> 07:12.000]  Like, everybody wants to build something that's simple, that's easy to understand, but that, like, makes you a living.\n",
            "[07:12.000 --> 07:15.000]  I mean, you're making more from this than you're making at your startup job, Lukas.\n",
            "[07:15.000 --> 07:17.000]  Yeah, it's actually a bit wild.\n",
            "[07:17.000 --> 07:28.000]  If you think that a countdown timer, like, the most unlikely thing that anybody would pay money for, makes me more money than a startup job, it's crazy.\n",
            "[07:28.000 --> 07:31.000]  Yeah, I saw a post, actually, where you guys talked about coming up with your idea.\n",
            "[07:31.000 --> 07:35.000]  I think it's really funny how you came up with your idea, because this is, like, the most generic startup advice ever.\n",
            "[07:35.000 --> 07:37.000]  It's like, keep your eyes open for problems in the world.\n",
            "[07:37.000 --> 07:40.000]  And, like, one day you'll find a problem that's worth solving, and then solve it.\n",
            "[07:40.000 --> 07:42.000]  And, like, almost nobody does that.\n",
            "[07:42.000 --> 07:43.000]  It's so hard to do that.\n",
            "[07:43.000 --> 07:46.000]  It's, like, incredibly hard to just stumble across an idea.\n",
            "[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  But that's exactly what you did.\n",
            "[07:48.000 --> 07:51.000]  You were at, I think, Lukas' friend's recording studio.\n",
            "[07:51.000 --> 07:52.000]  Yeah.\n",
            "[07:52.000 --> 07:58.000]  And then you saw them, like, start a timer on their iPad and then run to the control area to start controlling it.\n",
            "[07:58.000 --> 07:59.000]  Like, he didn't have a remote.\n",
            "[07:59.000 --> 08:03.000]  He had to, like, physically sprint across the studio to do his timer.\n",
            "[08:03.000 --> 08:04.000]  Exactly.\n",
            "[08:04.000 --> 08:09.000]  Yeah, it's like, I see him running in, you know, like, clicking this one button on the laptop, running back out,\n",
            "[08:09.000 --> 08:12.000]  seeing if there must be a better solution for this.\n",
            "[08:12.000 --> 08:18.000]  You know, many people say on Twitter, like, scratch your own itch, build a business that you yourself like.\n",
            "[08:18.000 --> 08:21.000]  And I looked around, like, I want to scratch somebody else's itch.\n",
            "[08:21.000 --> 08:25.000]  You know, I see this guy, like, can I build something that is a solution for him?\n",
            "[08:25.000 --> 08:30.000]  First of all, I thought, surely, surely somebody else has made something.\n",
            "[08:30.000 --> 08:35.000]  I feel like whenever you look in the world and it's like, there's such an obvious solution to this problem\n",
            "[08:35.000 --> 08:39.000]  that maybe you see because you have the background and everybody else just, like, doesn't know,\n",
            "[08:39.000 --> 08:41.000]  that that's a perfect business.\n",
            "[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  And I was like, I'm going to build this in one weekend.\n",
            "[08:43.000 --> 08:47.000]  And of course, like, free, you know, like, just very simple, put it on the internet, put it on Reddit.\n",
            "[08:47.000 --> 08:49.000]  It's like, you know, who cares?\n",
            "[08:49.000 --> 08:50.000]  Let's see if people want this.\n",
            "[08:50.000 --> 08:52.000]  If people want to use it, I just did it.\n",
            "[08:52.000 --> 08:55.000]  I get, like, I get skeptical when I see things that are obvious.\n",
            "[08:55.000 --> 08:56.000]  I'm like, ah, I can just build this in a weekend.\n",
            "[08:56.000 --> 08:59.000]  And I'm like, somebody has to have already solved this problem.\n",
            "[08:59.000 --> 09:01.000]  Like, it must be my friend who doesn't understand.\n",
            "[09:01.000 --> 09:03.000]  He's, like, running from the timer to the controller.\n",
            "[09:03.000 --> 09:04.000]  Like, he doesn't understand.\n",
            "[09:04.000 --> 09:05.000]  He's never Googled this.\n",
            "[09:05.000 --> 09:11.000]  But, like, there's no way, you know, it's 2023 and nobody's built, like, a timer.\n",
            "[09:11.000 --> 09:12.000]  Did you do any research?\n",
            "[09:12.000 --> 09:16.000]  Did you go back and try to find out, like, hey, like, does this exist?\n",
            "[09:16.000 --> 09:17.000]  Yeah.\n",
            "[09:17.000 --> 09:22.000]  So, like, on the very spot, I tried to find this solution and I couldn't.\n",
            "[09:22.000 --> 09:25.000]  Just a simple website that you open, have a timer.\n",
            "[09:25.000 --> 09:27.000]  That is remote controlled.\n",
            "[09:27.000 --> 09:34.000]  So, I build it and afterwards, I find, like, two or three solutions that are old Windows apps.\n",
            "[09:34.000 --> 09:39.000]  What's interesting is you did something that's the opposite of what Paul Graham said.\n",
            "[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  Just a couple of days ago, he tweeted,\n",
            "[09:42.000 --> 09:45.000]  when young founders build something that they don't want themselves,\n",
            "[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  but that they believe some group of other people want,\n",
            "[09:48.000 --> 09:52.000]  90% of the time, they're building something that nobody wants.\n",
            "[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  And even Elon Musk responded.\n",
            "[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  Yeah, it was, like, true.\n",
            "[09:56.000 --> 10:00.000]  But I would say also, this is the thing about percentages, right?\n",
            "[10:00.000 --> 10:01.000]  There is still the 10%.\n",
            "[10:01.000 --> 10:04.000]  He said nine, so there is still 10%, right?\n",
            "[10:04.000 --> 10:07.000]  And I'm not saying that other people should do it,\n",
            "[10:07.000 --> 10:11.000]  but I'm just saying that the smart thing in Luca's case,\n",
            "[10:11.000 --> 10:14.000]  that he always summarizes, you know, of course.\n",
            "[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  So, the story goes fast.\n",
            "[10:16.000 --> 10:20.000]  But the truth is that he went on Reddit and he asked, you know,\n",
            "[10:20.000 --> 10:24.000]  if he could use a countdown timer that would be controlled remotely,\n",
            "[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  what would this need to have?\n",
            "[10:26.000 --> 10:30.000]  And from that feedback, he actually created the first one.\n",
            "[10:30.000 --> 10:35.000]  And then other way, went back to Reddit and told people that he had created that.\n",
            "[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  So, that's how he got the first user.\n",
            "[10:37.000 --> 10:40.000]  So, I want to shine a bit of different light on this Graham tweet.\n",
            "[10:40.000 --> 10:41.000]  He's right, right?\n",
            "[10:41.000 --> 10:45.000]  But I feel like in our tech bubble, everybody knows about these tech things.\n",
            "[10:45.000 --> 10:49.000]  Like, all the tech problems have been solved with open source code and five times already.\n",
            "[10:49.000 --> 10:52.000]  But then you look at other industries, especially old industries,\n",
            "[10:52.000 --> 10:58.000]  metal manufacturing, and in this case, like event organizing and media recording.\n",
            "[10:58.000 --> 11:04.000]  There's so much low-hanging fruit that you as a developer coming from a startup,\n",
            "[11:04.000 --> 11:07.000]  you look at it and it's like, I would automate this, I would change this,\n",
            "[11:07.000 --> 11:09.000]  I would make this better.\n",
            "[11:09.000 --> 11:10.000]  There's so much low-hanging fruit.\n",
            "[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  I feel there's a lot of remote problems to be solved for developers in other industries.\n",
            "[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  I think that's spot on.\n",
            "[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  Until today, we see that all the time that people actually write us\n",
            "[11:21.000 --> 11:24.000]  because they love so much the interface of StageTimer.\n",
            "[11:24.000 --> 11:29.000]  They write and say, okay, do you have something like StageTimer but for this in the industry?\n",
            "[11:29.000 --> 11:32.000]  So, we get emails all the time, people asking like,\n",
            "[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  okay, but do you have something like StageTimer but for teleprompter?\n",
            "[11:35.000 --> 11:37.000]  Do you have something like StageTimer?\n",
            "[11:37.000 --> 11:40.000]  And then they are always mentioning things and we're like,\n",
            "[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  man, there are so many things that we could do in this industry.\n",
            "[11:43.000 --> 11:46.000]  Again, these low-hanging fruits that are still there to be taken.\n",
            "[11:46.000 --> 11:49.000]  It's fascinating because it's like in the world of technology,\n",
            "[11:49.000 --> 11:51.000]  like if you're a developer and you're building tools for other developers,\n",
            "[11:51.000 --> 11:54.000]  you go on GitHub, there's like millions of products.\n",
            "[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  Like programmers are solving every single little thing about every single thing\n",
            "[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  and somebody builds a library, then somebody comes and builds another library\n",
            "[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  to solve the problems with that library and it's just like tons and tons of stuff.\n",
            "[12:04.000 --> 12:09.000]  So, even if software engineers and nd hackers have already gotten to some other industry,\n",
            "[12:09.000 --> 12:12.000]  like let's say insurance, and they've already built some tools there,\n",
            "[12:12.000 --> 12:15.000]  they haven't built anything near what they built for software engineers.\n",
            "[12:15.000 --> 12:20.000]  It's guaranteed to be like something that you can build.\n",
            "[12:20.000 --> 12:23.000]  And sometimes it's as obvious as like, hey, you should be able to control this timer\n",
            "[12:23.000 --> 12:27.000]  with a remote and this old shitty Windows app is not good enough.\n",
            "[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  But sometimes it's a little bit deeper.\n",
            "[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  And I think that people can explore a little bit more here\n",
            "[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  and try to figure out what's going on in other industries.\n",

            "[12:39.000 --> 12:43.000]  But there's always these little niches for nd hackers that are little problems\n",
            "[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000]  that nobody really wants to solve because there's just not enough money in it.\n",
            "[12:46.000 --> 12:53.000]  But for a single person like me, like us, it's perfect and enough to grow a good business.\n",
            "[12:53.000 --> 12:58.000]  Patio11 had a really simple app for teachers.\n",

            "[13:03.000 --> 13:09.000]  And it was the exact same story where it's not a super sophisticated product.\n",
            "[13:09.000 --> 13:14.000]  And when he's talking to developers or to coders, eyebrows would go up.\n",
            "[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  Like, really? You're making a product out of that?\n",
            "[13:16.000 --> 13:20.000]  And the thing that he hammered the drum about all the time is like,\n",

            "[13:40.000 --> 13:43.000]  This wasn't just like a singular moment, boom, you have an app.\n",
            "[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  It was like a six-month process.\n",

            "[13:47.000 --> 13:51.000]  I thought it was so smart how you did it because the vast majority of indie hackers are like,\n",

            "[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  And then you literally put a link to your app.\n",

            "[14:38.000 --> 14:39.000]  You put a link to your app.\n",

            "[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  So I actually – first of all, I had to look for the subreddit.\n",
            "[14:49.000 --> 14:53.000]  It's so hard to find the subreddit if you're not knowledgeable.\n",
            "[14:53.000 --> 14:57.000]  So I found this tool where you put one subreddit and it gives you all the connections to the other ones, how they're related.\n",
            "[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  Is it like that network graph thing?\n",

            "[15:04.000 --> 15:05.000]  It's amazing.\n",
            "[15:05.000 --> 15:09.000]  And so I go there and exactly I thought, okay, how can you post this?\n",
            "[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  So people actually want to read it and want to respond, right?\n",
            "[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  Reddit, you can exhaust very quickly.\n",
            "[15:14.000 --> 15:20.000]  And funny, there's another tool, another timer that launched like a year later in the same subreddit.\n",
            "[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  And I read these posts and it was an open source tool.\n",
            "[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  And he posted first one.\n",
            "[15:25.000 --> 15:26.000]  Everybody was excited.\n",
            "[15:26.000 --> 15:29.000]  And then he posted like every single – like every week he posted.\n",
            "[15:29.000 --> 15:30.000]  And it petered out.\n",
            "[15:30.000 --> 15:31.000]  You can't do that.\n",
            "[15:31.000 --> 15:33.000]  On Reddit, you've got one post.\n",
            "[15:33.000 --> 15:34.000]  You make it short.\n",
            "[15:34.000 --> 15:35.000]  You make it to the point.\n",
            "[15:35.000 --> 15:36.000]  You ask for questions.\n",
            "[15:36.000 --> 15:37.000]  You don't advertise.\n",
            "[15:37.000 --> 15:38.000]  You got it.\n",
            "[15:38.000 --> 15:41.000]  And then like six months later, I was like, okay, now I did it.\n",
            "[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  Like, hey, with your help, I did it.\n",
            "[15:43.000 --> 15:44.000]  Check it out.\n",
            "[15:44.000 --> 15:45.000]  What do you think?\n",
            "[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  Oh, that's smart.\n",
            "[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  And that was when we launched the paid version.\n",
            "[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  That's when we launched the paid version.\n",
            "[15:50.000 --> 15:51.000]  But I didn't mention the paid version.\n",
            "[15:51.000 --> 15:54.000]  I just said like, hey, thanks for your help.\n",
            "[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  I built this thing and now it's a thing.\n",
            "[15:56.000 --> 15:57.000]  And it's awesome.\n",
            "[15:57.000 --> 16:01.000]  There's a hilarious comment on your first Reddit post that I liked.\n",
            "[16:01.000 --> 16:04.000]  It was like someone's basically talking about a different time route that they found\n",
            "[16:04.000 --> 16:08.000]  where, you know, a speaker might have ten minutes, but you can actually speed up the timer.\n",
            "[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  So really only nine minutes go by.\n",
            "[16:10.000 --> 16:13.000]  But the countdown looks like it's counting to ten.\n",
            "[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  And it's like the most amazing trick for basically making sure your speakers don't go over time\n",
            "[16:17.000 --> 16:18.000]  and everything runs smoothly.\n",
            "[16:18.000 --> 16:19.000]  Do you guys have that?\n",
            "[16:19.000 --> 16:21.000]  Did you end up adding that feature to your app?\n",
            "[16:21.000 --> 16:25.000]  This is literally the one oldest feature on our backlog.\n",
            "[16:25.000 --> 16:30.000]  I have not built it yet because it's such a mind boggling hard task on a distributed server.\n",
            "[16:30.000 --> 16:31.000]  Oh, true.\n",
            "[16:31.000 --> 16:34.000]  We get some very funny requests, actually.\n",
            "[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  But we also get some ultimatums.\n",
            "[16:37.000 --> 16:42.000]  I mean, not anymore, but in the beginning, it was really funny building stage timer,\n",
            "[16:42.000 --> 16:47.000]  really listening to the users because we didn't know any better.\n",
            "[16:47.000 --> 16:48.000]  Right.\n",
            "[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  We didn't know how the industry works.\n",
            "[16:50.000 --> 16:54.000]  So I remember the first time I got an email and the person said like,\n",
            "[16:54.000 --> 16:58.000]  oh, can you add this and this so I can build a rundown with stage timer?\n",
            "[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  And I was like, what is a rundown?\n",
            "[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  And then I asked because I had no idea.\n",
            "[17:02.000 --> 17:06.000]  So it was really funny entering an industry with no prior knowledge.\n",
            "[17:06.000 --> 17:11.000]  But then also the user base, right, teaching us and educating us.\n",
            "[17:11.000 --> 17:13.000]  There was this one guy that was really funny.\n",
            "[17:13.000 --> 17:17.000]  I think it was one of our first yearly subscriptions.\n",
            "[17:17.000 --> 17:21.000]  And he wrote very straightforward.\n",
            "[17:21.000 --> 17:22.000]  He said, I love stage timer.\n",
            "[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  And here are the things that I would like to see on stage timer.\n",
            "[17:26.000 --> 17:31.000]  Because if you don't have these things by next year, then I'm not going to renew my subscription.\n",
            "[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  Like, I just gave you money.\n",
            "[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  You better have this next year.\n",
            "[17:35.000 --> 17:36.000]  This guy is like the mafia.\n",
            "[17:36.000 --> 17:42.000]  Yeah, he was awesome because then we had exactly what a producer needs.\n",
            "[17:42.000 --> 17:46.000]  You know, he was really organized and he mentioned the most important things.\n",
            "[17:46.000 --> 17:52.000]  And we are very thankful for the input of this guy and many other people that wrote us.\n",
            "[17:52.000 --> 17:57.000]  Because we didn't know what they needed for the event production space.\n",
            "[17:57.000 --> 18:00.000]  Sometimes we just hopped on a call like, hey, can we have a call with you?\n",
            "[18:00.000 --> 18:03.000]  Can you tell us what you're actually doing?\n",
            "[18:03.000 --> 18:08.000]  And of course, the cool thing is that when you're dealing with early adopters, they're super excited.\n",
            "[18:08.000 --> 18:11.000]  So they were actually thanking us for the time.\n",
            "[18:11.000 --> 18:16.000]  They were feeling so good, you know, for talking to people that work for stage timer.\n",
            "[18:16.000 --> 18:22.000]  And until today, we get messages and even people saying, please send my thanks to the team, you know.\n",
            "[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  And then I just turned to look and I was like, yeah, thank you.\n",
            "[18:24.000 --> 18:25.000]  And that's it.\n",
            "[18:25.000 --> 18:28.000]  Because people actually believe that we are a larger team.\n",
            "[18:28.000 --> 18:33.000]  And recently, you even met a person and the person said, oh, you are one of the engineers?\n",
            "[18:33.000 --> 18:36.000]  And I was like, yeah, well, a bit more than that.\n",
            "[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  It's cool because what you're doing is basically proving that you don't have to solve your own problems.\n",
            "[18:40.000 --> 18:46.000]  And I think solving your own problem is a little bit overrated because at the end of the day, you're trying to find other customers.\n",
            "[18:46.000 --> 18:49.000]  And they're going to be different than you no matter what.\n",
            "[18:49.000 --> 18:52.000]  Even if you know an area inside and out, other people are going to be different than you.\n",
            "[18:52.000 --> 18:59.000]  And if you don't keep your ears and eyes open to listen to what they have as problems and what they want, you're going to be dead.\n",
            "[18:59.000 --> 19:03.000]  And so you might as well get in the habit of doing that from day one by solving other people's problems.\n",
            "[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  And I like that you posted on the subreddit.\n",
            "[19:05.000 --> 19:07.000]  And like you said, you posted again.\n",
            "[19:07.000 --> 19:12.000]  So you later on like came back and you were like, okay, hey, it's been six months.\n",
            "[19:12.000 --> 19:13.000]  Here's a link to my old post.\n",
            "[19:13.000 --> 19:14.000]  Thank you.\n",
            "[19:14.000 --> 19:15.000]  And you were super smart again with how you did it.\n",
            "[19:15.000 --> 19:17.000]  Like thank you so much for the advice.\n",
            "[19:17.000 --> 19:18.000]  It was so great.\n",
            "[19:18.000 --> 19:19.000]  It's so helpful.\n",
            "[19:19.000 --> 19:22.000]  Just so you know, like here's what the new product is like with all your advice added.\n",
            "[19:22.000 --> 19:23.000]  So you're not like advertising.\n",
            "[19:23.000 --> 19:27.000]  You're just like participating as a community member.\n",
            "[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  I've tried to get people to do this for Indie Hackers for so long.\n",
            "[19:29.000 --> 19:30.000]  It's so hard.\n",
            "[19:30.000 --> 19:33.000]  You get like a group of Indie Hackers or founders together, put them on a forum.\n",
            "[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  Everybody just wants to advertise.\n",
            "[19:35.000 --> 19:37.000]  And I think everybody cares about what they're doing.\n",
            "[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  And it's like, nobody cares about what you're doing.\n",
            "[19:39.000 --> 19:40.000]  They care about themselves.\n",
            "[19:40.000 --> 19:41.000]  They want to feel smart.\n",
            "[19:41.000 --> 19:42.000]  They want to feel important.\n",
            "[19:42.000 --> 19:43.000]  They want to feel helpful.\n",
            "[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  And like, I feel like you're one of the few people who did that right.\n",
            "[19:45.000 --> 19:50.000]  And so I think after that second Reddit post is when you got, is that when you got your very first paying customer?\n",

            "[19:51.000 --> 19:54.000]  So I pushed out on Twitter and I had like 300 followers at that time.\n",
            "[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  Like, okay, nobody's going to read it.\n",
            "[19:56.000 --> 19:57.000]  But you know, that's what you do.\n",
            "[19:57.000 --> 19:58.000]  Build it public.\n",
            "[19:58.000 --> 19:59.000]  Push it out.\n",
            "[19:59.000 --> 20:00.000]  You know, tweet it out.\n",
            "[20:00.000 --> 20:02.000]  And just the same night, somebody purchased it.\n",
            "[20:02.000 --> 20:04.000]  I was like, this is incredible.\n",
            "[20:04.000 --> 20:07.000]  You know, your first dollar online is some magical moment.\n",
            "[20:07.000 --> 20:09.000]  I contact the guy, write him on Twitter.\n",
            "[20:09.000 --> 20:12.000]  It's like, hey, why did you buy my thing?\n",
            "[20:12.000 --> 20:15.000]  It's like, I know you from this first Reddit post.\n",
            "[20:15.000 --> 20:17.000]  And I just followed you.\n",
            "[20:17.000 --> 20:18.000]  And I love it.\n",
            "[20:18.000 --> 20:19.000]  I love new things.\n",
            "[20:19.000 --> 20:20.000]  I love what you're doing.\n",
            "[20:20.000 --> 20:21.000]  I bought it right away.\n",
            "[20:21.000 --> 20:26.000]  And it just knocked me off that it's from this first Reddit post actually somebody purchased.\n",
            "[20:26.000 --> 20:28.000]  Are you guys, are you, like, how much do you tweet?\n",
            "[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  I know we were reading that one Twitter thread that you have.\n",
            "[20:30.000 --> 20:33.000]  But I haven't really, like, I just followed both of you.\n",
            "[20:33.000 --> 20:37.000]  How big is Twitter in your, like, marketing and growth strategies?\n",
            "[20:37.000 --> 20:38.000]  Nothing.\n",
            "[20:38.000 --> 20:42.000]  Because all the people on Twitter, like, there's an event diagram between the people on Twitter\n",
            "[20:42.000 --> 20:45.000]  and the people that do video, live video recording and events.\n",
            "[20:45.000 --> 20:47.000]  It's like, there's almost no overlap.\n",
            "[20:47.000 --> 20:48.000]  Don't touch.\n",
            "[20:48.000 --> 20:49.000]  Exactly, yeah.\n",
            "[20:49.000 --> 20:52.000]  We just created actually now a Twitter first stage timer.\n",
            "[20:52.000 --> 20:57.000]  But it is not at all our, it's not even a customer acquisition channel for us.\n",
            "[20:57.000 --> 20:59.000]  So it's not a focus at all for us.\n",
            "[20:59.000 --> 21:04.000]  And then, as Luca said, the first users came from Reddit.\n",
            "[21:04.000 --> 21:10.000]  And then the coolest part is that it grew mainly through word of mouth in the beginning.\n",
            "[21:10.000 --> 21:16.000]  So because this industry is so tightly knitted, so it's just the way it is for them.\n",
            "[21:16.000 --> 21:19.000]  As soon as they find something, they tell others.\n",
            "[21:19.000 --> 21:24.000]  And the most amazing part about this industry is, as you can imagine, they are great with video.\n",
            "[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  So I think 90% of these people are actually YouTubers.\n",
            "[21:28.000 --> 21:33.000]  So what happened is that people started making videos about stage timer.\n",
            "[21:33.000 --> 21:39.000]  And then we have these really cool videos made about stage timer that we didn't even commission.\n",
            "[21:39.000 --> 21:42.000]  It's just because they're excited and they want to share with other people.\n",
            "[21:42.000 --> 21:45.000]  So every now and then we get an email from a user and say,\n",
            "[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  oh, I just saw that so-and-so mentioned you.\n",
            "[21:47.000 --> 21:51.000]  And then they send the video with the minute already, you know, that I should watch.\n",
            "[21:51.000 --> 21:58.000]  And it's becoming this tool in the space where people even reference already as if it's like a house brand.\n",
            "[21:58.000 --> 22:05.000]  And then, for example, the other day I saw that a big creator in the space, he mentioned stage timer.\n",
            "[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  Actually, he was using stage timer.\n",
            "[22:07.000 --> 22:12.000]  And then he mentioned that he wanted to do something related to a timer.\n",
            "[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  And two people on the comments on the live on YouTube said, yeah, but you should check\n",
            "[22:16.000 --> 22:19.000]  because stage timer actually allows you to do that.\n",
            "[22:19.000 --> 22:22.000]  It was such a moment for me because like, oh, look at that.\n",
            "[22:22.000 --> 22:26.000]  They actually mentioned stage timer as like Nike, you know?\n",
            "[22:26.000 --> 22:27.000]  It's like the Nike of the space.\n",
            "[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  It's just like you don't have to say anything else.\n",
            "[22:29.000 --> 22:30.000]  It's just stage timer.\n",
            "[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  That's really cool to see that it's developing like this in the industry.\n",
            "[22:34.000 --> 22:35.000]  That's awesome.\n",
            "[22:35.000 --> 22:41.000]  And word of mouth is, I mean, I think it's the best type of marketing because your customers aren't being marketed at.\n",
            "[22:41.000 --> 22:44.000]  The downside of it is that it's relatively slow.\n",
            "[22:44.000 --> 22:48.000]  And so you had your first Reddit customer.\n",
            "[22:48.000 --> 22:53.000]  But what were you doing while your revenue grew by word of mouth?\n",
            "[22:53.000 --> 22:57.000]  And like Lucas, I know that at first you were working at a startup.\n",
            "[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  Liz, what were you doing?\n",
            "[22:59.000 --> 23:05.000]  So actually, I only joined a few months after he created the paid version.\n",
            "[23:05.000 --> 23:09.000]  Before, I was working in humanitarian work.\n",
            "[23:09.000 --> 23:13.000]  And I was working in social development and so on.\n",
            "[23:13.000 --> 23:21.000]  And then when I joined Lucas in September 2021, I started helping him exactly to grow the tool.\n",
            "[23:21.000 --> 23:28.000]  One thing that Lucas did that was quite genius, and this again comes from the way he functions, is that he called the thing stage timer.\n",
            "[23:28.000 --> 23:31.000]  It's just like calling a clock a clock, right?\n",
            "[23:31.000 --> 23:37.000]  So because he called stage timer stage timer, SEO came by default, right?\n",
            "[23:37.000 --> 23:44.000]  So when people were stage timer, then you would show we were already on the first page pretty fast because of that.\n",
            "[23:44.000 --> 23:49.000]  So this was already SEO then became the largest, actually, word of mouth.\n",
            "[23:49.000 --> 23:52.000]  It was the second largest growth channel, so to say.\n",
            "[23:52.000 --> 24:02.000]  And then since we saw that SEO would be the way for us, then we started tackling SEO more intentionally and found out that the best way,\n",
            "[24:02.000 --> 24:10.000]  because it's such a technical industry, is to just do technical blogs or documentation even better.\n",
            "[24:10.000 --> 24:16.000]  Because these top of funnel silly blogs, you know, that usually you can do other projects, doesn't work in this case.\n",
            "[24:16.000 --> 24:19.000]  Because if I make those, we bring the wrong traffic.\n",
            "[24:19.000 --> 24:24.000]  These are the people that won't convert because they don't need such a complex timer, right?\n",
            "[24:25.000 --> 24:33.000]  So funnily enough, one of the things that brings us the most paying customers is a documentation about how to use a countdown timer with OBS.\n",
            "[24:33.000 --> 24:42.000]  So we started to realize, OK, we have to go very technical, which is hard because we don't know the technicalities of the industry so well.\n",
            "[24:42.000 --> 24:50.000]  But that's how we then started growing, of course, then ads and we keep expanding to get more and more customers.\n",
            "[24:50.000 --> 24:53.000]  So paddling back a little bit, right, you ask, what do you do with your time now?\n",
            "[24:53.000 --> 24:57.000]  And I was in the same position probably, many people in the same position, like, oh, first dollar.\n",
            "[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  What do you do? What do you do?\n",
            "[24:59.000 --> 25:03.000]  So as one does, I go on Twitter and I ask, how do I do marketing for this tool?\n",
